- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
Class components have access to state or lifecycle methods like componentDidMount() 

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
ComponentDidMount() - change the state of our application and further render data 
ComponentDidUpdate()- updates what is on the page 
ComponentWillUnmount()- removes the component from the dom 
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
allows you to have a reausable hook that can be used for purposes outside of state. also, a good substitute for some HOC's. 
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
so we make sure that things are working properly in more than one instance.
